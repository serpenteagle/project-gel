# Project Gel

Project Gel (Final name TBD) is a software UX design language targeted at digitally literate laptop/desktop users. 

The goal is to create a minimal design system that provides maximum human-machine interface efficiency to digitally literate users while being stylistic enough to provide a delightful experience in pursuit of positive brand reinforcment.

The system is designed with heavy influence from 4 different concepts: fundamental cognitive psychology (that which remains largely the same across humans from all areas of the planet), physical/spatial logic, cultural influence on cognition, and transferential cognition gained from modern day digital literacy.

That being said, the following knowledge will be assumed:

## Fundamenal Cognitive Psychology

[ --- ]

## Digital/Spatial Logic

[ --- ]

## Cultural Influence on Cognition

[ --- ]

## Transferential Cognition from Digital Literacy

[ --- ]



## 2 Phases: 
1. Discovery
2. Learning

Learned (at the end of learning phase)

A universal help element should be accessible to the user at any time to receive help and instruction on interfacing with the software.

A 3rd person 3d overview of the current view may be displayed to provide an intuitive clue as to how to interface with the UI.

## Types of interface
(Relative to the computer)

Input: data, action/command related -> navigation related

Output: consumable data, conversational data

## Layout and nav
Should be spatially logical and consequential in nature.
